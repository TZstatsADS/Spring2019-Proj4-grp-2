to

nternally
to

n

we

the

was
the

that
the

therefore
we

our

after

th

an

not

if

sevenitem

met
hlth

to
express

on
then
pendlng

afterwards
mr
talcott
wrote
to
these
busmessmen
let
me
quote
from
that
letter
a
representatlves
of
the
people
w
cannot
n
practlcal
or
polltlcal
sensey
support
an

or
cm
b
wlthout

of

the
people
we
dlrectly
represent
we
need
support
as
you
need
a

your
m
must
be
the

there
no
easy
way
to
leapfrog
them
to
persuade
a
group
of
leg
lslators
you
can
you
must
begln
by
persuadlng
your
employees
vour
nvestors
who
are
our
constltuents
they
pack
the
polltlcal
clout
they
can
be
moblllzed
but
i
as
a
leglslator
cannot
do
w
at
least
wlthout
vour
help
perhaps
one
of
your
unlon
leaders
should
have
appeared
mm
you
one
unlon
leader
would
have
unpressed
more
than
half
of
our
delegatlon
mr
talcotts
advlce
to
the
callfornla
busmessmen
was
echoed
by
rep
barber
conable
of
new
york
one
of
the
brlghtest
and
most
capable
members
of
the

when
he
spoke
not
long
ago
to
a
group
of
pflzer
management
personnel
he
counselled
pflzer
to
talk
to
own
people
so
that
they
would
understand
why
mr
conable
takes
the
posltlons
he
does
wlthout
such
backup
mr
conable
vulnerable
mr
talcotts
reference
to
a
unlon
leader
doesnt
mean
that
unlon
leaders
are
more
persuaslve
than
busmessmen
simply
means
that
from
a
congressmans
perceptlon
unlon
spokesmen
presently
represent
more

than
we
do
that
perceptlon
certalnly

we

the

when

he

our

elther

lacks

a

problem
stemmlng
from
such
thlngs
as

flxlng

i
do

except
for

todays

consclously

rather
these

happen
because
not
enough
attentlon
paid
to

that
will
prevent

and
so
i
make
thls
suggestlon
that
every

have
a

of
nternal
audltlng
whlch
has
the
express
purpose
of
dentlfyng
for

potentlal

hlthln
the

x
my
bellef
that
somewhere

are
always

bemg
crossed
or
some
practlce
bemg
followed
that
questlonable
from

vlew
there
must
be
a

for

so
that

can
take
correctlve
steps
before
lay

practlcally
all

a

collectlvely

most

hlth

remember

where

nfomatlon
systems
we
have
heard
the
term
dlstrlbuted
control
systems
for
the
last
several
years
you
are
llke
me
you
had
an
dea
of
what
was
meant
but
were
a
llttle
vague
in
a
simplified
dlstrlbuted
system
there
somethlng
m
be
controlled
for

a

ndcates

where
analyzed

necessary
correctlve
actlon
taken
to

close

adjust
the
valve
early
analog
devlces
were
elementary
by
todays
digital
standards
the
modern
controller
much
smarter
however
nelther
sees
all
nor
knows
all
some
jobs
are
too
compllcated
for
to
handle
a
hlgher
capaclty
central
process
computer
will
monltor
many
parameters
as
well
as
signals
to

from
the

can
make
far
more
complex
calculatlons
conslderlng
nput
from
many
sources
cma
can
tell
the

what
actlon
to
take
and
may
even
reprogram
to
react
properly
to
changed
condltlons
equally
mportant
the
maln
computer
can
be
equipped
hlth
a
volumlnous
and
rellable
long

memory
can
store
process
data
then
n
case
of
an
upset
can
retrleve
and
analyze
the

to
lsolate
the
cause
in
an
ntegrated
system
the
nformatlon
also
avaliable
to
busmess
computers
to
process
management
nfomatlon
fortunately
for
us
humans
even
the
central
computer
needs
to
be
monltored
and
occaslonally
corrected
so
there
are
operators
but
they
are
operatlng
mm
far
more
powerful

mlght
mpact
on

effect
the

our

we
mentloned
that
the

and
soclal
securlty
reform
would
domlnate
the

of
both

and
that
we
dld
not
expect

we

that

durlng

thus
maklng
even

we
also
stated
that
thls
dld
not

that

made
to

we
had
to

no

dld
not

presented
the

the

m
preempt

to

cma
t
concerned
mm
raising

whlle
we
can
support
the
cma
posltlon
i
am
convlnced
that
we
must
address
a
more
serlous
longitem
issue
the
chemlcal
ndustry
faces
a
major
problem
a
problem
so
severe
shakes
cma
and
many
of
the
companles
obvlous
confllcts
of
vlew
that
are
serlous
there
are
they
are
serlous
because
each
tax
proposal
can
have
a
major
adverse
unpact
on
i
i
some
of
the
companles
hlthln
the
ndustry
our
argument
can
be
that
thls
ndustry
supports
reauthorlzatlon
at
the
seam
mllllon
level
hlth
a
llmlted
annual
borrowlng
authorlzatlon
however
thls
ndustry
does
not
have
the
r
venue
capaclty
to
fund
the
major
socletal
cost
of
a
new
welfare
program
i
j
i
no
one
especlally
our
leglslators
should
be
allowed
to
lose
slght
of
the
fact
that
a
complete
cleanup
of
all
hazardous
waste
sltes
n
the
unlted
states
another
w
lfare
program
and
that
becomes
partlcularly
true
the
vlctlm
compensatlon
leglslatlon
marrled
to
thls
program
t
we
must
make
the
cogent
economc
arguments
and
make
them
n
terms
that
are
both
bellevable
and
reallstlc
even
at
a
bllllon
annual
fundlng
level
the
chemlcal
ndustry
does
not
collapse
however
the
real
effect
when
the
tax
becomes
centered
on
a
very
narrow
revenue
base
of
give
or
take
seven
chemlcals
and
give
or
take
companles
that
an
eroslon
beglns
that
moves
productlon
of
the
partlcular
chemlcals
off
shore
eroslon
may
be
more
pernlclous
than
collapse
that
cma
eroslon
will
soon
begln
because
for
most
of
the
affected
chemlcals
there
worldwlde
excess
capaclty
from
the
point
ofivlew
of
the
chemlcal
companles
the
fact
that
the
productlon
may
move
from
unlted
states
sources
to
forelgn
sources
may
be
good
news
or
bad
news
dependlng
upon
the
ndvdual
companys
worldwlde
capaclty
sltuatlon
and
worldwlde
market
posltlon
from
a
unlted
states
government
viewpoint
any
movement
of
productlon
out
of
the
unlted
states
defeats
the
revenue
raising
capablllty
of
the
tax
thus
the
tax
simply
wont
work
as
rate
goes
up
revenue
base
th
tax
commlts
sulclde
by
kllllng
moreover
eroslve
effect
dlmlnlshes
the
general
ncome
tax
base
as
well
the
staffs
of
the
commlttees
responslble
for
raising
revenues
can
be
made
to
understand
thls
argument
however
we
must
artlculate
carefully
and
wlthout
overstatement
because
overstatement
will
be
followed
by
complete
dlsbellef
and
we
cannot
afford
that
consequence
we
can
make
a
strong
posltlve
argument
for
a
wasteend
tax
based
on
equlty
and
falrness
equlty
n
that
compels
people
to
do
what
they
ought
to
do
that
mply
dlspose
of
thelr
waste
n
an
envlronmentally
safe
fashlon
falrness

that
all

who

pay

of

whlle
we
as

can

our

treats

perceptlon
that

are
causlng

as
a

rather

a

the

for

was
the

consensus
that
we
would
be
better
advlsed
not
to
put
too

in

and
instead
work
mm

the

in

our

he
forecasts
our

flat
n
desplte
the

that

will
be
up
about

to
about

ncreaslng

at

lest
we
draw
consolatlon
from
the
fact
that
we

any

at

lets
dlssect
meanlng
a

means

gloomler
than
our

suggests
if
we

to
calculate
a

profltablllty
balance
the
net
effect
of

i
